# Yakuza_Substory_Analysis

In this Jupyter Notebook I show off some of the skills I learned while studying data analysis. These skills include web scraping (using the Beautiful Soup library in Python), plotting (using the Matplotlib library), and proficiency with the pandas library. For the topic of this project, I chose to do something related to the Yakuza video game series since it is my favorite series of all time. Then, I decided that it would be fun to answer some questions regarding the substories (side missions) across all the mainline games that are currently released.
The Excel workbook file shows some summaries of the data that I got using pivot tables. The Power BI file shows some more visualizations of the data.
